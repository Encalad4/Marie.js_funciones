# Basic Assembly Functions for MARIE.js

This repository contains a collection of basic Assembly functions specifically designed for the **MARIE.js** virtual computer. **MARIE.js** is a web-based simulator of the **MARIE** (Machine Architecture that is Really Intuitive and Easy) computer, which is widely used in computer science education to teach fundamental concepts of computer architecture and assembly language programming.

## Features

This repository includes a set of basic MARIE Assembly Language programs, such as:

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Demonstrates basic arithmetic functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, implemented in MARIE Assembly Language.
- **Functions from Other Languages**: Translations of common programming functions from other languages into MARIE Assembly, such as finding maximum/minimum values, sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort), and simple mathematical functions.
- **Basic Programs**: Simple standalone programs that cover fundamental concepts, including input/output operations, basic arithmetic, and data manipulation in MARIE Assembly.
- **Looping Structures**: Examples of loop constructs, both simple and nested loops, demonstrating iterative processes like counting, summing series, or repeating instructions.
- **Conditional Statements**: Programs that utilize the `Skipcond` instruction for decision-making, including if-else structures and conditional loops.
- **Memory Management**: Basic examples of how to manage memory in MARIE, including storing, loading, and modifying data in memory locations.
- **Error Handling**: Simple programs that handle basic errors or invalid inputs, demonstrating how to manage unexpected behavior in MARIE programs.
- **Recursive Functions**: Demonstrations of recursive algorithms, such as calculating a factorial or the Fibonacci sequence, adapted to the MARIE architecture.
